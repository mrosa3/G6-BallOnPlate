## 1. Introduction
The ball and plate balancing system consists of a plate which can be tilted by two dual axis servo motors with a ball rolling around on top of the plate. The challenge in this design experiement is to balance the ball on top of the plate to a desired position. This involves using the position of the rotary servo motors attached to the bottom of the plate based on the X-Y position of the ball being measured overhead with a vision sensor. An image of the model can be seen below:
